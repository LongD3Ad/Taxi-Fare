# NYC Taxi Fare Prediction Project: To-Do List

## Project Overview
- [x] Define project objective: Predict taxi fares using NYC taxi trip dataset
- [x] Obtain dataset: 'yellow_tripdata_2020-01.csv' (6.5+ million rows)

## Data Preprocessing
- [x] Perform initial data cleaning
- [x] Handle missing values
- [x] Correct data types
- [x] Engineer new features:
  - [x] `trip_duration`
  - [x] `tip_percentage`
  - [x] `fare_per_mile`
  - [ ] Additional features (if needed)
- [x] Apply MinMaxScaler to normalize numerical features

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- [x] Analyze zero-tip trips:
  - [x] Distribution analysis
  - [x] Characteristic exploration
- [x] Investigate correlation between:
  - [x] `payment_type`
  - [x] `trip_duration`
  - [x] `tip_percentage`
- [x] Create initial data visualizations:
  - [x] Box plots
  - [x] Violin plots
  - [x] Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
- [x] Explore relationship between payment methods and tipping behavior

## Current Focus: Numerical Data Analysis
- [ ] Revert normalization for:
